# SmartPass - Chrome Extension

SmartPass is a Chrome extension. It generates strong passwords and plugs them in all at once into fields on web pages for passwords. This enables the customer to generate robust, random passwords on-the-fly, hence offering more security. It works well with static and dynamic websites and is able to run on even the newest pages like Google and Facebook.

## Features

- **Password Suggestion Button**: Generates and fills in a robust password into any password field.
- **Secure Password Generation**: This generates a random sixteen-character password consisting of all types of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Dynamic Page Compatibility**: Supports dynamic pages loaded with `MutationObserver` so that it will be compatible with modern websites.
- **Customization**: The common sense of password generation may be customized to change the length or allowed characters.
 
## How It Works

Any website containing a password field will contain an automatically provided "Suggest Password" button to the right of the field. Upon clicking this button, a strong password is created and is entered into the password field for you. It is lightweight and fast so as not to compromise your browsing experience.
